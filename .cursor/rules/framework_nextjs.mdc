## Next.js Rules

- Use file-based routing in the `pages` or `app` directory appropriately.
- Fetch data using `getServerSideProps`, `getStaticProps`, or `app router` conventions.
- Avoid non-deterministic logic in server-rendered functions.
- Keep shared layout and SEO meta setup in `_app.tsx` or layout.tsx.
