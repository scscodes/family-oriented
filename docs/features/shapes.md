## Technical Implementation

### Architecture
```
src/app/games/shapes/
├── page.tsx (main shapes game)
├── sorter/
│   └── page.tsx (shape sorter variant)
├── GameBoard component (shared)
├── useGame hook
└── generateShapeQuestions utility
```

### Question Generation Logic
- **Shape Pool**: 21+ predefined shapes including:
  - Basic geometric: Circle, Square, Triangle, Rectangle, Diamond
  - Advanced: Star, Heart, Plus, Minus
  - Directional: Up, Down, Left, Right arrows
  - Objects: Umbrella, Wrench, Cake, Call, Smile, Sun, Moon, Cloud
- **Algorithm**: Random shape selection with duplicate prevention

- **Difficulty Scaling**: Mix basic and complex shapes

### Data Flow
1. `useGame("shapes")` hook initializes game state
2. `generateShapeQuestions()` creates diverse question set
3. `GameBoard` renders questions with shape visualization
4. Results tracked and spatial learning assessed

## Configuration & Settings

### Default Settings
```typescript
{
  numberRange: {
    min: 0,
    max: 0 // Not applicable for shapes
  },
  questionCount: 10,
  optionsCount: 4
}
```

### Customizable Parameters
