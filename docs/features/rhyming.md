# Rhyming Words Game Feature

## Overview

The Rhyming Words game helps children identify words that rhyme, developing phonemic awareness and sound pattern recognition essential for reading and language development.

## Game Design

### Educational Objectives
- **Primary**: Rhyme recognition and phonemic awareness
- **Secondary**: Sound pattern identification and vocabulary building
- **Skills Developed**: Auditory discrimination, phonetic patterns, language play

### Target Age Group
- **Primary**: Ages 4-7
- **Secondary**: Ages 3-8 (with varying complexity)

### Visual Design
- **Theme Color**: `#64f7e7` (Cyan/Turquoise)
- **Icon**: ðŸ§© (Puzzle piece)
- **Subject Classification**: Language Arts

## Technical Implementation

### Architecture
```
src/app/games/rhyming/page.tsx
â”œâ”€â”€ GameBoard component (shared)
â”œâ”€â”€ useGame hook
â””â”€â”€ generateRhymingQuestions utility
```

### Rhyme Generation Logic
- **Word Pool**: Carefully curated words with clear rhyming patterns
- **Rhyme Families**: Organized by common ending sounds (-at, -og, -ight)
- **Algorithm**: Present target word and find matching rhyme
- **Difficulty Progression**: Simple rhymes to complex sound patterns

### Rhyme Categories
- **Simple Rhymes**: Cat/hat, dog/log, sun/fun
- **Long Vowel Rhymes**: Cake/make, bike/like, boat/coat
- **Complex Patterns**: Light/sight/night, bear/care/share
- **Near Rhymes**: Advanced patterns for older children

### Data Flow
1. `useGame("rhyming")` hook initializes game state
2. `generateRhymingQuestions()` creates rhyme matching challenges
3. `GameBoard` renders target word and rhyming options
4. Phonemic awareness and rhyme recognition tracked

## Configuration & Settings

### Default Settings
```typescript
{
  numberRange: { 
    min: 0, 
    max: 0 // Not applicable for rhyming
  },

}
```

### Rhyme Complexity Levels
