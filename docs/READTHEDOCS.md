# Read The Docs

## General Rules
- For local development, expect a Windows-based environment; use CMD/powershell-compatible commands and syntax
- Keep changes constrained to the task at hand
- Avoid sweeping changes unless directed

## Coding Standards
- Keep code short, highly focused and easily testable
- Always check for unit tests, and keep them up to date
- Prefer explicit types and use of data structures, like interfaces
- Avoid use of Any or Unknown types
- Adhere to industry, language and framework best practice by default
- Before updating source control, ensure build and test commands complete successfully

## Documentation
- Keep documentation clear, concise, and up to date
- Document all critical or complex logic, including examples as required
- Create a tasks.md file to track progress over large or multi-step tasks
- Tasks should be ordered, and clearly define their purpose and expected outcome that is easily validated
