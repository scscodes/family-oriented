- **Subscription Plans Table**: Complete with tier, pricing, limits, and features
- **Organizations Table**: Proper org structure with subscription relationships
- **Users Table**: Extended profiles with org membership and roles
- **Permission System**: Hierarchical policies for granular control
- **RLS Security**: Multi-layered row-level security implementation

#### 2. **Subscription Service** (ROBUST)
- **Feature Gating**: Comprehensive tier-based access control
- **Usage Limits**: Avatar, collection, and session limits by tier
- **Utility Methods**: Plan comparison, usage summary, upgrade suggestions
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript integration with database types

#### 3. **User Context & Roles** (SOLID)
- **Loading State Management**: Consolidated loading without UI flashing
- **Role Guard System**: Safe role-based rendering with `useRoleGuard()`
- **View As Support**: Role assumption for testing and validation
- **Demo Mode**: Professional tier demo with realistic data

#### 4. **React Hooks** (GOOD)
- **useSubscription**: Feature checking and usage limit validation
- **useUser**: User context with role management
- **Integration**: Seamless integration with existing components

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Critical Gaps Identified**

#### 1. **Tier Transition Management** (MISSING)
- **No Upgrade/Downgrade UI**: No interface for plan changes
- **No Billing Integration**: Missing payment provider integration
- **No Transition Validation**: No checks for usage limits during downgrades
- **No Proration Logic**: No handling of billing cycles and prorations
- **No Transition History**: No audit trail of plan changes

#### 2. **Account Management Process** (INCOMPLETE)
- **Limited Organization Settings**: Basic info only, missing advanced settings
- **No Billing Information**: No billing address, payment methods, or invoices
- **No Account Lifecycle**: No cancellation, suspension, or reactivation flows
- **No Usage Analytics**: No detailed usage tracking for billing purposes

#### 3. **User Management** (BASIC)
- **No User Invitation System**: Cannot invite new users to organization
- **Limited Role Assignment**: Basic role display but no assignment UI
- **No User Lifecycle**: No user activation, deactivation, or removal
- **No Audit Logging**: No tracking of user management actions

#### 4. **Billing & Payment** (ABSENT)
- **No Payment Processing**: No integration with Stripe, PayPal, etc.
- **No Invoice Management**: No billing history or invoice downloads
- **No Payment Method Management**: No credit card or payment method updates
- **No Billing Notifications**: No alerts for failed payments or renewals
