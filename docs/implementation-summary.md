2. **Filter by multiple tags** - Combine tags like "counting + beginner + audio"
3. **Browse by categories** - Explore tags organized by skill type, interaction, etc.
4. **Use advanced facets** - Filter by age range, duration, skill level, and features
5. **Sort results** - Order by relevance, difficulty, duration, or alphabetical
6. **Share filtered views** - URL state enables bookmarking and sharing specific filters
7. **See real-time counts** - Understand how many games match each filter combination
8. **Track learning progress** - Analytics provide insights into learning patterns and recommendations

## ðŸ”„ Next Steps
The enhanced discovery foundation is now ready for:
- **Task A.5**: Advanced Filter Combinations with persistence
