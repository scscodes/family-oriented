# Future Game Ideas

> **Note**: This document contains potential future game features that could be implemented. The current focus has been on establishing a solid architecture with comprehensive styling system, accessibility compliance, and quality codebase foundation.

## Creative Play (Optional Future Features)

### Color Mixing Game
- Mix two colors to get the correct third color
- **Skill**: Color theory, experimentation
- **Implementation**: Could extend existing color game mechanics with blending logic

### Build a Creature
- Pick parts (head, body, tail) and quiz the player about what animal they built
- **Skill**: Imagination + recall
- **Implementation**: Would require image asset management and part combination logic

## Memory & Logic (Future Expansion)

### Memory Flip Game
- Classic card match with animals, letters, or shapes
- **Skill**: Concentration, memory
- **Implementation**: Would need card flip animations and memory state management

### Find the Difference
- Spot differences between two cartoon scenes
- **Skill**: Observation
- **Implementation**: Requires custom image assets and difference detection logic

## Math & Numbers (Potential Extensions)

### Number Pop
- Balloons float with numbers, pop the ones that add to 10
- **Skill**: Addition, mental math
- **Implementation**: Would need animation system and dynamic target calculation
