### ⚡ **MAJOR ARCHITECTURAL IMPROVEMENT: User Context Loading State Refactor** ✅
**Priority**: CRITICAL - Eliminates flashing UI elements and improves user experience

**Problem Solved**: 
- Role-based UI elements (like User Management button) were flashing on/off during load
- Multiple loading states (`loading`, `rolesLoading`) completing at different times
- Race conditions between user authentication, role loading, and avatar loading
- Inconsistent demo mode initialization

**Solution Implemented**:
1. **Consolidated Loading State System** ✅
   - Single `LoadingState` interface tracking: `user`, `roles`, `avatars`, `isReady`
   - Helper `updateLoadingState()` function with automatic `isReady` calculation
   - Eliminated race conditions by coordinating all loading phases

2. **Enhanced Role Guard Pattern** ✅ 
   - New `useRoleGuard()` hook for safe role-based rendering
   - `hasRole()` only returns true when `isReady` is true
   - Components now use `isReady && hasRole()` pattern to prevent flashing

3. **Improved Demo Mode** ✅
   - Robust fallback system: database demo → hardcoded demo
   - Professional tier demo user with proper roles and permissions
   - Complete loading state coordination for demo mode

4. **Parallel Data Loading** ✅
   - Roles and avatars load in parallel instead of sequential
   - Faster initial load times
   - Better error handling with proper cleanup

5. **Component Updates** ✅
   - `ProfileMenu`: Uses `useRoleGuard()` to prevent User Management link flashing
   - `DashboardPage`: Role-based admin button rendering with loading safety
   - `UserManagementDashboard`: Proper permission checks with loading states

**Files Modified**:
- `src/context/UserContext.tsx` - Complete refactor with consolidated loading
- `src/components/ProfileMenu.tsx` - Role guard integration
- `src/app/dashboard/page.tsx` - Role guard integration  
- `src/app/dashboard/user-management.tsx` - Role guard integration

**Technical Benefits**:
- ✅ Eliminated all UI flashing issues
- ✅ Improved perceived performance
- ✅ More robust error handling
- ✅ Better separation of concerns
- ✅ Type-safe loading state management
